**EMC 2 Arduino**
==============

EMC 2 Arduino is a small collection of files intended to allow a person with
an Arduino Mega2560 (or UNO), an old USB enabled computer and a free copy of
LinuxCNC to begin building their very own CNC machine cheaply and quickly with
a variety of components, ranging from low-end inexpensive (even salvaged)
components such as old steppers and computer parts to high-end linear servos.

**Details**
--------------
EMC 2 Arduino and HAL2Arduino are different attempts at solving the same problem.  EMC 2 Arduino is no longer in development.

The current version of HAL2Arduino is 0.6d.  The previous versions are available as well.

Instructions.txt has a good amount of documentation.

Right now we're just beginning, accepting advice, contributions of code and skill
as well as learning too.
